Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen when they must train an army to become as ruthless and blood thirsty as their reputation has become.","popularity":76.841,"poster_path":"/5X3VOy9lD44VclKsWTi8gHZGjhL.jpg","release_date":"2014-07-25","title":"Hercules","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3588,"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwayne Johnson","original_name":"Dwayne Johnson","popularity":44.709,"profile_path":"/kuqFzlYMc2IrsOyPznMd1FroeGq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hercules","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c75124149","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian McShane","original_name":"Ian McShane","popularity":22.173,"profile_path":"/q9qKbux5Jo76Sj8g3luxBt6rYtz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Amphiarus","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c75124151","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hurt","original_name":"John Hurt","popularity":14.058,"profile_path":"/wGDGhBOggA8I2ktgc1QoHABEF0m.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cotys","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c7512414d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rufus Sewell","original_name":"Rufus Sewell","popularity":22.518,"profile_path":"/yc2EWyg45GO03YqDttaEhjvegiE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Autolycus","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c75124155","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aksel Hennie","original_name":"Aksel Hennie","popularity":2.771,"profile_path":"/sceuNjVXtsHOS3cn0MsLfZRkAQx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tydeus","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c7512415d","order":4}],"directors":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brett Ratner","original_name":"Brett Ratner","popularity":3.712,"profile_path":"/uOtFtBPkLQaTq8TobPG0XvNKrvD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c75124139","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}],"keyPerson":{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwayne Johnson","original_name":"Dwayne Johnson","popularity":44.709,"profile_path":"/kuqFzlYMc2IrsOyPznMd1FroeGq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hercules","credit_id":"52fe4cbd9251416c75124149","order":0}},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/zTxHf9iIOCqRbxvl8W5QYKrsMLq.jpg","genre_ids":[12,35,14],"id":512200,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Jumanji: The Next Level","overview":"As the gang return to Jumanji to rescue one of their own, they discover that nothing is as they expect.
